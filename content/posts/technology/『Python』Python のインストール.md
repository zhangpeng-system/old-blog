## Homebrewでインストール

macOS ならHomebrewを利用してPythonを便利インストールできますが、Pythonのバージョン

```
~ ➤ brew search python                                                        git:master*

==> python@3.11: stable 3.11.3 (bottled)
Interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language
https://www.python.org/
Not installed
From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/HEAD/Formula/python@3.11.rb
License: Python-2.0
==> Dependencies
Build: pkg-config ✘
Required: mpdecimal ✔, openssl@1.1 ✔, sqlite ✘, xz ✔
==> Caveats
Python has been installed as
  /opt/homebrew/bin/python3

Unversioned symlinks `python`, `python-config`, `pip` etc. pointing to
`python3`, `python3-config`, `pip3` etc., respectively, have been installed into
  /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.11/libexec/bin

You can install Python packages with
  pip3 install <package>
They will install into the site-package directory
  /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.11/site-packages

tkinter is no longer included with this formula, but it is available separately:
  brew install python-tk@3.11

gdbm (`dbm.gnu`) is no longer included in this formula, but it is available separately:
  brew install python-gdbm@3.11
`dbm.ndbm` changed database backends in Homebrew Python 3.11.
If you need to read a database from a previous Homebrew Python created via `dbm.ndbm`,
you'll need to read your database using the older version of Homebrew Python and convert to another format.
`dbm` still defaults to `dbm.gnu` when it is installed.
